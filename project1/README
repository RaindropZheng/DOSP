Problem:
change a string into SHA256 hashcode, find the required number of leading 0 and print the result.

How to use:
We built this project on Visual Studio for Mac, and we have two files, one is 
LocalClient, and one is LocalServer.
1. LocalClient is for finding the strings that the hash values have the n leading 
0, which n is got from server.
1.1 First in the client command line, we need to input filename + IP 
address. Ex, localClient localhost
1.2 Function cal_hash is used for calculating hash values
1.3 Function ranStr is used for generating the random string with a length 
of n
1.4 ActorList is used for finding the results and sending them to server. 
Results are like “changzhou;yudizheng; ”+string+hash_value
1.5 We use localClient to send and receive message from server. The 
message we send are address of server and calculation results. The 
message we receive from server is the number of leading 0
2. LocalServer is for printing the results
2.1 We use localServer to send and receive message from client.
